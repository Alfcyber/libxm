libxm
=====

A small XM (FastTracker II Extended Module) player library. Designed
for easy integration in demos and such, and provides timing functions
for easy sync against specific instruments, samples or channels.

Written in C11 and released under the WTFPL license, version 2.

Size
====

The playback routine (assuming the non-portable `.libxm` format is
loaded, see `xmconvert` below) fits in under 7KiB of compressed
machine code.

Examples
========

Some example programs are provided.

* `xmgl` is a music visualiser that uses OpenGL and JACK for very
  precise audio synchronisation. See a demo here:
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZkhl6XBUVM> or something similar
  that runs in the browser:
  [libxm.js](https://artefact2.github.io/libxm.js/).

* `xmtoalsa` is a simple player that uses the ALSA library. It
  produces `xmp`-like output while playing. Use `xmtoalsa --help` (or
  check the source) to see the full usage.

  ~~~
  ./xmtoalsa --random **/*.xm
  ~~~

* `xmtowav` will play a module and output a `.wav` file.

  ~~~
  ./xmtowav my_module.xm my_module.wav
  ~~~

* `xmtoau` will play a module and output a `.au` file to standard
  output.

  ~~~
  mpv <(./xmtoau my_module.xm)
  ~~~

* `xmbench` is a benchmark program.

* `xmconvert` will convert a module to the non-portable format. The
  file produced is much larger than the original module, but it
  compresses down to about the same size (XXX: not true at the
  moment). The non-portable format can be loaded by libxm in much less
  code, resulting in smaller executable sizes.

* `libxmtoau` is similar to `xmtoau`, except that it loads
  non-portable files generated by `xmconvert`.

Here are some interesting modules, most showcase unusual or advanced
tracking techniques (and thus are a good indicator of a player's
accuracy):

* [Cerror - Expatarimental](http://modarchive.org/module.php?136603)
* [Lamb - Among the stars](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165819)
* [Raina - Cyberculosis](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165308)
* [Raina - Slumberjack](http://modarchive.org/module.php?148721)
* [Strobe - One for all](http://modarchive.org/module.php?161246)
* [Strobe - Paralysicical death](http://modarchive.org/module.php?65817)

Known issues
------------

* Only loads FastTracker II-compatible XM files.

* Loading a bogus file (that yet has a valid 60-byte header) will
  probably result in a segmentation fault.

* Big endian architectures are not yet supported.

Tests
=====

Some test XM files are in the `tests` directory. Their goal is to test
a certain feature against regressions. A summary of tests (and what
they are supposed to test) is in the table below.
